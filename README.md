GitHub Action to deploy your site with Vercel and create a GitHub deployment.

</div>

## üëã Introduction

[deploy-to-vercel-action](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/deploy-to-vercel-action) uses GitHub Actions to deploy your project/site to [Vercel](https://vercel.com). It offers more customization than Vercel's GitHub integration in terms of when to deploy your site. Using GitHub Actions [Events](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows) you can choose to deploy every commit, only on new releases or even on a cron schedule. The Action can also deploy every PR and comment on it with the preview url. It uses the Vercel CLI and can automatically create a Deployment on GitHub as well.

## üöÄ Features

- Use GitHub Actions Events to control when to deploy to Vercel
- Automatically deploy every Pull Request
- Comment on Pull Request with a preview link
- Create a deployment on GitHub

## üìö Usage

Before you can start using the Action, you have to setup a few Action inputs. Refer to the [configuration](#%EF%B8%8F-configuration) section below for more info.

Then create a `.yml` file in your `.github/workflows` folder (you can find more info about the structure in the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)) and add the following:

**.github/workflows/deploy.yml**

```yml
name: Deploy CI
on:
  push:
    branches: [master]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: "!contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[skip ci]')"
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Deploy to Vercel Action
        uses: BetaHuhn/deploy-to-vercel-action@v1
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
          VERCEL_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          VERCEL_ORG_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
          VERCEL_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
```

### Versioning

To always use the latest version of the Action add the `latest` tag to the action name like this:

```yml
uses: BetaHuhn/deploy-to-vercel-action@latest
```

If you want to make sure that your Workflow doesn't suddenly break when a new major version is released, use the `v1` tag instead (recommended usage):

```yml
uses: BetaHuhn/deploy-to-vercel-action@v1
```

With the `v1` tag you will always get the latest non-breaking version which will include potential bug fixes in the future. If you use a specific version, make sure to regulary check if a new version is available, or enable Dependabot.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Action Inputs

Here are all the inputs [deploy-to-vercel-action](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/deploy-to-vercel-action) takes:

| Key | Value | Required | Default |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub Token to use when creating deployment and comment (more info [below](#tokens)) | **Yes** | N/A |
| `VERCEL_TOKEN` | Vercel Token to use with the Vercel CLI (more info [below](#tokens)) | **Yes** | N/A |
| `VERCEL_ORG_ID` | Id of your Vercel Organisation (more info [below](#vercel-project)) | **Yes** | N/A |
| `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` | Id of your Vercel project (more info [below](#vercel-project)) | **Yes** | N/A |
| `DEPLOY_PRS` | Deploy every PR to Vercel | **No** | true |
| `GITHUB_DEPLOYMENT` | Create a deployment on GitHub | **No** | true |
| `PRODUCTION` | Create a production deployment (has no impact on PR deployments). | **No** | true |
| `VERCEL_SCOPE` | Execute commands from a different Vercel team or user. | **No** | N/A |
| `PR_LABELS` | Labels which will be added to the pull request once deployed. Set it to false to turn off | **No** | deployed |

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

In order for the Action to interact with GitHub and Vercel on your behalf, you have to specify your GitHub and Vercel Access Tokens as well as your Vercel Organisation and Project Id.

### Tokens

You can generate your GitHub Personal Access token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and your Vercel Token [here](https://vercel.com/account/tokens) and then specify them as `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `VERCEL_TOKEN` in the Actions inputs.

> **Note:** It is recommneded to set the tokens as [Repository Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).

### Vercel Project

Before you can start using this Action you have to link your project with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/download) locally.

Run the command `vercel` inside your projects root and follow the steps described by the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli).

Once set up, a new `.vercel` directory will be added to your directory. The `.vercel/project.json` file contains both the organization (`orgId`) and project (`projectId`) id of your project.

You can then specify them as `VERCEL_ORG_ID` and `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` in the Actions inputs.

> **Note:** It is recommneded to set them as [Repository Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).
